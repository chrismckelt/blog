# Use the DevOps Radar to guide your way

> Focus on metrics that will accelerate your software delivery process, how to obtain them and how to improve them

When it comes to measuring an organisationâ€™s ability to develop and operate software systems nothing beats the key metrics identified in the 2019 Accelerate State of DevOps [Report](https://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/state-of-devops-2019.pdf) by DevOps Research and Assessment (DORA).

The report clearly demonstrates the empirical links between high performing software teams and high performing organisations and provides evidence-based guidance on the capabilities and practices that accelerate digital transformation.

This research, together with our extensive delivery experience, forms the basis of our DevOps practice.

### The Approach

- 5 day engagement schedule to suit your team
- Interviews with technology leaders to evaluate the current state, understand the measurement potential, and determine metrics to measure
- Data analysis to obtain metrics
- Radar presentation of insights and detailed action plan for continual improvement

### Benefits and Outcomes

- Current state visibility
- Visual radar
- Identified issues
- Actions for improvement
