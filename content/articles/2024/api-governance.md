# The Integrations Lifecycle

The Integrations Lifecycle follows a **Design Thinking – Lean Startup – Agile** approach.

## Design Thinking

**Design Thinking** is an iterative process in which we seek to understand the user, challenge assumptions, and redefine problems to identify alternative strategies and solutions that may not be immediately obvious. It is a solution-focused approach, combining a mindset with hands-on methods.

In the context of integration design, requirements are defined by the business processes they support. Design Thinking focuses on understanding business processes, identifying inefficiencies, and ideating integration capabilities that improve those processes.

## Integration Types

- **Data Integration**
  Batch-oriented, dealing with data at rest (i.e., the process creating the data has already completed).

- **Application & System Integration**
  Real-time integration of live operational data between two or more applications.
  - **Request-based** (e.g., _do this now_)
  - **Message-based** (e.g., _do this when you get a chance_)
  - **Event-based** (e.g., _this happened_)

The mode of integration is driven by business process requirements and the constraints of the underlying technology.

## Lean Approach

The **Lean Startup methodology** is a scientific approach to problem solving. It draws on feedback data to guide and accelerate iterative integration development.

This involves:

- Assessing options against defined criteria
- Experimenting with technologies and patterns
- Gaining evidence-based knowledge of performance and constraints
- Using insights to influence the final design

---

## Agile

**Agile** is a way of working, characterized by frequent, incremental delivery of product, and ongoing reassessment and adaptation of plans.

---

## API Strategy

APIs are central to integration, service platforms, innovation, and connectivity. They:

- Enable monetization opportunities
- Enhance core business functions
- Foster global partnerships and standardization (e.g., Open Banking)

When combined with cloud scalability, IoT, and machine learning, APIs provide endless possibilities for innovation. To keep pace, organizations require infrastructure that aligns with business growth, adapts rapidly, and prioritizes usability and monetization.

**Our proven approach to API Strategy helps you:**

- Accelerate understanding
- Bring confidence to investments
- Fuel agility
- Avoid complexity and drift

# API Lifecycle

The API Lifecycle follows the **CI/CD pipeline for API Management (APIM)** approach:
