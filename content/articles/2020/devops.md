# DevOps Metrics Workshop

> Understand what to measure and how to use metrics to accelerate your business.
> A one-day facilitated workshop focusing on the metrics that will accelerate your software delivery process—what to measure, how to obtain them, and how to improve them.

---

When it comes to measuring an organisation’s ability to develop and operate software systems, nothing beats the key metrics identified in the **2019 Accelerate State of DevOps [Report](https://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/state-of-devops-2019.pdf)** by DevOps Research and Assessment (DORA).

The report demonstrates the empirical links between high-performing software teams and high-performing organisations, providing evidence-based guidance on the capabilities and practices that accelerate digital transformation.

This research, combined with our extensive delivery experience, forms the foundation of our **DevOps practice**.
