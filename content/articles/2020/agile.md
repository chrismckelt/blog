# Agile Coaching

> Our coaches focus on embedding Agile at the individual team level, using traditional frameworks like **Scrum** and **Kanban**.

We may work with one team or multiple teams, including those interacting with groups outside the immediate team. Our focus is on enabling and developing agility at the “make” or “build” level.

We ensure that teams can build products the right way and deliver work sustainably.
