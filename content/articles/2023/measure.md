# Understand what to measure and how to use them to accelerate your business

> Focus on metrics that will accelerate your software delivery process, learn how to obtain them and how to improve them

When it comes to measuring an organisationâ€™s ability to develop and operate software systems nothing beats the key metrics identified in the 2019 Accelerate State of DevOps [Report](https://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/state-of-devops-2019.pdf) by DevOps Research and Assessment (DORA).

The report clearly demonstrates the empirical links between high performing software teams and high performing organisations and provides evidence-based guidance on the capabilities and practices that accelerate digital transformation.

This research, together with our extensive delivery experience, forms the basis of our DevOps practice.

### The Solution

- Discovery workshops and interviews to evaluate the current state, understand measurement potential, and determine metrics

- Presentation report on findings, metric availability and techniques to measure and improve

### Benefits and Outcomes

- Reference leading research linking software speed, stability and availability to organisational performance

- Understand the importance of performance data and identify the key metrics needed

- Articulate their current performance metrics maturity and identify their key gaps and opportunities

- Take immediate action to get the right metrics in place, and build better software, faster!
