# FinOps

**FinOps** is a portmanteau of _Finance_ and _DevOps_, emphasizing communication and collaboration between business and engineering teams.

At its core, **FinOps is a cultural practice**. It enables teams to manage cloud costs by ensuring that everyone takes ownership of their usage, supported by a central best-practices group. Cross-functional teams across Engineering, Finance, and Product work together to accelerate product delivery while maintaining financial control and predictability.

## FinOps Principles

FinOps Principles act as the north star for guiding activities within a FinOps practice.
They were initially developed by FinOps Foundation members and first introduced in September 2019 as part of the _Cloud FinOps_ book in collaboration with AWS.

Since then, these principles have expanded to cover multi-cloud environments, evolving as cloud services rapidly change each quarter.
