# Where possible, we choose to adopt OSS software to avoid vendor lock in.

The open source community and specifically the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://www.cncf.io/) host a large amount of world class projects, some used under the covers by major cloud providers and charged back to you at a premium. We unlock the value of the global community to power your solutions & endeavour to give back what we can in return.
