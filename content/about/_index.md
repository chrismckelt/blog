## Hey there! Iâ€™m Chris ðŸ‘‹

I am passionate about helping teams deliver great experiences through Agile methodologies and software engineering best practices with a focus on cloud-native solutions.

My experience ranges from start-ups to global organizations with a focus on financial segments including lending, insurance, investment management, and banking.

I have worked in London, Sydney, and Perth and have led teams across the world including South Africa, New Zealand, Philippines, Vietnam, and India (across Bangalore, Delhi, Mumbai).

Outside of work I enjoy the beach with my son, building/riding electric vehicles, and trying to perfect my BBQ technique.
